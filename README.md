# Jared Rounsavall

Woah! Hey there.

Ever wondered what it would be like to have a real human living in your codebase?
Well now you can do that, so stop wondering and add me as a dependency.

```
npm i --save jared-rounsavall
```

# Useful

Ask me useful things through code like:

- "how was your day"
- "how do I cook a thanksgiving dinner"

# Humble

Nobody who codeified themselves into a dependency could ever be anything else.

# A E S T H E T I C

Your project will probably get more attention with me involved, which is nice.

# Contributing
