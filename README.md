Ever wondered what it would be like to have a real human living in your codebase?
Well now you can do that, so stop wondering and add me as a dependency to your latest JavaScript project.

```
npm i jared-rounsavall

*But if you're here for business purposes..*

Self-driven and goal oriented, I'm always looking for new ways to challenge and improve myself.

I love working closely with both teams & stakeholders in an open and transparent development process. A regular dialogue with firm expectations (both internally and externally) makes development more fun and encourages cooperation between groups.

Let's build something cool!

# Goals

"The more I learn, the more I realize how little I know."

Realizing how much there is to learn and how many opportunities for improvement there are encourages me to tackle any challenge head-on.

I want to grow and build things that people enjoy.

Hopefully I can do something innovative along the way that people will appreciate.
