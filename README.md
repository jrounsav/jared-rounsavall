Whether it's as an individual contributor or tech lead, I'm really passionate about solving cool problems. Finding the line between delivery for immediate business needs and "future-proofing" is a practice that I find super engaging.

When I'm not taking care of business, you might find me cooking, hiking, writing or lifting some weights. Live music & a stiff drink can be pretty nice too.
